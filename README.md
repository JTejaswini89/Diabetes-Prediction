# Diabetes Prediction Project

<i>This is a machine learning project where I built a model to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical data like glucose level, BMI, age, etc.

I used the kaggle Dataset for training and testing. The main goal of this project is to learn how to handle real-world data, train models, evaluate them, and make predictions.

## Tools & Libraries Used<i>
- Python<br>
- Pandas, NumPy<br>
- Scikit-learn<br>
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)<br></i>

## What This Project Includes<i>
- Data cleaning and preprocessing<br>
- Training different ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)<br>
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score<br>
- (Optional) A simple prediction script or interface to test with new data<br></i>

## How to Run<i>
1. Clone this repo.<br>
2. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`. <br>
3. Run the main script or notebook to train and test the model.<br>
4. Use the predict script to try it out with your own data.<br></i>
